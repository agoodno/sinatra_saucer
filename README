Sinatra Saucer
==============
JRuby web application frontend for Flying Saucer. 

It converts xhtml into a pdf. It requires a zip file containing the file pdf.html, along with any css and images referenced in the xhtml file. There is a rudimentary form to submit a zip file, but it is expected the file will be sent by another application. This is to allow for the power of PDF creation with Flying Saucer without requiring your whole application to run in JRuby.

So far the upload form works for creating a PDF. Coming soon will be documentation on how to use it from another app.

Gems required: pbrant-flyingsaucer4r (0.5+), jruby (1.3+), rubyzip, and sinatra

To get started, type this in the command line:
jruby -S rackup config.ru

The default port for rack is 9292.

See sinatra_saucer_client.rb for an example of a client that can use Sinatra Saucer. In Rails, use render_to_string to get the xhtml to pass to the client.
